LLM_HINT - the messiest code assistant program you've ever seen!

Suggests code to be put in place of a comment that starts with "x/" (like "//x/make name uppercase")

Place `token.txt` with a [Groq](https://groq.com) token in the same directory with `__main__.py`, run `__main__.py` passing file paths as arguments, review the result and optionally apply the fix automatically by pressing "Enter"! DON'T LOOK AT THE SOURCE CODE
